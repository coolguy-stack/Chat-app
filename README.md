Created a React.js and Firebase based chat app. Currently running into issues with integrating it into a website. 

In order to use it, simply download the files and go to ~/superchat/App.js. From there you can use npm to start the remote connection and you will be greeted with our chat app.
Still working on the CSS to spruce up the UI.
